EnginBERT
A domain-specific text embedding model focused on engineering literature. EnginBERT leverages BERT's architecture and is fine-tuned to handle specialized engineering terminology, enabling more effective tasks like information retrieval, clustering, and classification within engineering fields.

Repo: EnginBERT
Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Transformers, Custom Tokenizer, Git LFS
Highlights: Created to address the limitations of general-purpose NLP models for engineering literature, EnginBERT is tailored for engineering-specific tasks, with a focus on precision in domain-specific vocabulary and concepts.
