# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Tristan Kruse, a passionate professional with a strong focus on **Supply Chain Management**, **Data Analytics**, and **Operations Research**. Currently pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics & Operations Research, I'm deeply interested in leveraging technology to solve complex supply chain challenges.

💻 My work involves tools and technologies like Python, SQL, Power BI, AWS, and Tableau, with applications in reinforcement learning, forecasting, and decision optimization.

🌟 Highlights:
- Interned at Genpact, developing dashboards and optimizing data workflows to enhance supply chain operations.
- Modeled and solved complex supply chain problems, including the Beer Game, using Reinforcement Learning.
- Worked on innovative projects like EnginBERT for engineering literature retrieval and a returns optimization model using Neural Networks.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-kruse), and check out my CV [here](Data%20Analyst%20-%20Resume_Tristan_Kruse.pdf) for more details about my journey.

Thanks for visiting!





## 🔬 Featured Projects

EnginBERT
A domain-specific text embedding model focused on engineering literature. EnginBERT leverages BERT's architecture and is fine-tuned to handle specialized engineering terminology, enabling more effective tasks like information retrieval, clustering, and classification within engineering fields.

Repo: EnginBERT
Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Transformers, Custom Tokenizer, Git LFS
Highlights: Created to address the limitations of general-purpose NLP models for engineering literature, EnginBERT is tailored for engineering-specific tasks, with a focus on precision in domain-specific vocabulary and concepts.
