### Welcome to My GitHub! 🌟

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Tristan Kruse, a passionate professional with a strong focus on **Supply Chain Management** and **Data Analytics**, Currently pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics & Operations Research, I'm deeply interested in leveraging technology to solve complex supply chain challenges.

💻 My work involves tools and technologies like Python, SQL, Power BI, AWS, and Tableau, with applications in reinforcement learning, forecasting, and decision optimization.

🌟 Highlights:
- Interned at Genpact, developing dashboards and optimizing data workflows to enhance supply chain operations.
- Modeled and solved complex supply chain problems, including the Beer Game, using Reinforcement Learning.
- Worked on innovative projects like EnginBERT for engineering literature retrieval and a returns optimization model using Neural Networks.

Thanks for visiting!





## 🔬 Featured Projects

### EnginBERT
A domain-specific text embedding model focused on engineering literature. EnginBERT leverages BERT's architecture and is fine-tuned to handle specialized engineering terminology, enabling more effective tasks like information retrieval, clustering, and classification within engineering fields.

Repo: [EnginBERT](https://github.com/janMagnusHeimann/EnginBERT)
Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Transformers, Custom Tokenizer, Git LFS
Highlights: Created to address the limitations of general-purpose NLP models for engineering literature, EnginBERT is tailored for engineering-specific tasks, with a focus on precision in domain-specific vocabulary and concepts.

### OmniChannel-RL
A reinforcement learning framework for modeling returns and decision-making in omnichannel retail. The project leverages a Hierarchical Markov Decision Process (HMDP) and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to optimize ordering and allocation strategies for retailers operating online and offline channels with resellable returns.

Repo: [OmniChannel-RL](https://github.com/TristanKruse/Modelling_returns_omni-channel_retail_Reinforcement_Learning)
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Gym
Highlights: Achieved a 3% reduction in total costs and up to a 17% increase in service levels. The model is based on the framework outlined in the paper J. Goedhart, R. Haijema, and R. Akkerman (2023), showcasing the potential of reinforcement learning in complex, hierarchical decision-making environments.

### Beer-Game-RL
A reinforcement learning solution for the Supply Chain Beer Game. Modeled the game's supply chain dynamics in Python (NumPy, Pandas) and implemented Q-Learning to optimize ordering strategies. Achieved a 31% reduction in total costs by modifying the state space, demonstrating the potential of RL in supply chain optimization.

Repo: [Beer-Game-RL](https://github.com/TristanKruse/Beer-Game-RL)
Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Q-Learning
Highlights: Combines supply chain simulation with reinforcement learning to explore automated decision-making and cost minimization in complex systems.
