### Welcome to My GitHub! üåü

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Tristan Kruse, a passionate professional with a strong focus on **Supply Chain Management** and **Data Analytics**, Currently pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics & Operations Research, I'm deeply interested in leveraging technology to solve complex supply chain challenges.

üíª My work involves tools and technologies like Python, SQL, AWS, and Tableau, with applications in reinforcement learning, forecasting, and decision optimization.

üåü Highlights:
- Interned at Genpact, developing dashboards and optimizing data workflows to enhance supply chain operations.
- Modeled and solved complex supply chain problems, including the Beer Game, using Reinforcement Learning.
- Worked on innovative projects like EnginBERT for engineering literature retrieval and a returns optimization model using Neural Networks.

Thanks for visiting!





## üî¨ Featured Projects

### Meal Delivery Algorithm
A dynamic vehicle routing system for the Restaurant Meal Delivery Problem (RMDP), implementing real-time order assignment and route optimization. This project simulates delivery operations with multiple routing strategies, including the Anticipatory Customer Assignment (ACA) heuristic and a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm integrated with ACA to optimize postponement decisions for enhanced order bundling and assignement. The system is validated using the Meituan Challenge dataset and features real-time visualization to analyze routing performance.

**Repo**: [RMDP_Algorithm](https://github.com/TristanKruse/RMDP_Algorithm)  
**Technologies**: Python, PyTorch (for RL), NumPy, PyYAML, Matplotlib  
**Highlights**:  
- Achieves a **10% reduction in total delay times** and a **7 percentage point increase in fill rates** by optimizing order assignment and bundling through strategic postponement.  
- Simulates dynamic order arrivals, stochastic food preparation times, and real-time decision-making for realistic delivery operations.  
- Includes interactive visualization to monitor vehicle routes, order statuses, and performance metrics like delay times and bundling efficiency.  
- Demonstrates advanced logistics optimization with potential applications in food delivery and dynamic vehicle routing.

### OmniChannel-RL
A reinforcement learning framework for modeling returns and decision-making in omnichannel retail. The project leverages a Hierarchical Markov Decision Process (HMDP) and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to optimize ordering and allocation strategies for retailers operating online and offline channels with resellable returns.

Repo: [OmniChannel-RL](https://github.com/TristanKruse/Modelling_returns_omni-channel_retail_Reinforcement_Learning)
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Gym
Highlights: Achieved a 3% reduction in total costs and up to a 17% increase in service levels. The model is based on the framework outlined in the paper J. Goedhart, R. Haijema, and R. Akkerman (2023), showcasing the potential of reinforcement learning in complex, hierarchical decision-making environments.

### Beer-Game-RL
A reinforcement learning solution for the Supply Chain Beer Game. Modeled the game's supply chain dynamics in Python (NumPy, Pandas) and implemented Q-Learning to optimize ordering strategies. Achieved a 31% reduction in total costs by modifying the state space, demonstrating the potential of RL in supply chain optimization.

Repo: [Beer-Game-RL](https://github.com/TristanKruse/Beer-Game-RL)
Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Q-Learning
Highlights: Combines supply chain simulation with reinforcement learning to explore automated decision-making and cost minimization in complex systems.
